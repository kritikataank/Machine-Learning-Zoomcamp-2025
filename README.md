# Machine-Learning-Zoomcamp-2025 Homework Repository

Welcome! This repository contains **module-wise homework assignments** from the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlzoomcamp) by DataTalks.Club. I am participating in Cohort 2025 to gain hands-on ML experience. Each module folder contains Jupyter notebooks with exercises along with my notes.

The ML Zoomcamp teaches **real-world ML workflows** using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and deployment tools.
