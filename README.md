## Python Data Science Environment Setup

This repository includes setup instructions and examples for installing essential Python packages for data science and machine learning.

### Quick Start

1. **Open the Setup Notebook**: Open `python_setup.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. **Run All Cells**: Execute all cells to install and verify the required packages
3. **Alternative Installation**: Use the requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Required Packages

- **Python**: Programming language (available in Jupyter environment)
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization library
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library

### Files

- `python_setup.ipynb`: Interactive notebook with installation instructions and examples
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages for easy installation

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Using the Jupyter Notebook
Open `python_setup.ipynb` and run all cells. The notebook includes:
- Installation commands for each package
- Verification tests
- Example usage demonstrations

#### Method 2: Using requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Method 3: Manual installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Verification

After installation, verify everything works by running the test cells in the notebook. You should see:
- Package version information
- Simple NumPy array operations
- Basic Pandas DataFrame creation
- Matplotlib sine wave plot
- Seaborn scatter plot

All packages should import without errors and display their version numbers.
